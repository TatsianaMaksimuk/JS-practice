//Build JavaScript Objects
//Objects are similar to arrays, except that instead of using indexes to access and modify their data,
// you access the data in objects through what are called properties.
//Objects are useful for storing data in a structured way, and can represent real world objects, like animal.
// You can even omit the quotes for single-word string properties.
